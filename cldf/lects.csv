Various different processes of vowel assimilation often occur after metathesis, of which the most regular is complete assimilation of final /a/, e.g. *quzan > *usa > /uus/ ‘rain’. Any double vowel (sequence of two identical vowels) in Mambae — including one created by metathesis — is realised as a single phonetically long, e.g. [uːs] ‘rain’. However, this length is not marked in this wordlist when a double vowel is penultimate, probably due to the length being interpreted as a side effect of stress which is predictably penultimate. Northwest Mambae also has a suffix /-a/ which is used in the citation form of (some) alienable nouns.
